My name is **Yani**, and this is my personal blog. I'm working as an office employee. My work is only a camouflage, until now I'm still searching what suits me best.

I have an interest in joining a triathlon race although I never swim in the sea, nor have a racing bike. I guess finishing a marathon and trail run is what got me into this.

I have a dream to be a global citizen.


***Regards***
