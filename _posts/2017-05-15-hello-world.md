This is the day this site goes live. I had always wanted to have my own on-line website, for the sake of... existence -_-''

As a non geeky person, I consider making a website as a challenge for me after I stumbled upon my [friend's website](http://www.mbaharsyah.xyz).  He bought a domain and hosted his website in [Github](https://github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). None of those things are familiar to me. Also when I read about [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an alternative for html formatting, I Googled it for some times because I didn't have idea what it was. You can say I am that type of person who barely update about the technology.

So, I signed up to some websites and download some tools to start the project:

- Signed up to [idwebhost](https://idwebhost.com/) to buy an .xyz domain with discounted price for the first year with only Rp. 9900
- Signed up to Github as the place for free repository/hosting and made [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Download Github client for desktop to ease commit to Github
- Installed Jekyll through command prompt
- Download [Typora](https://typora.io/) as a tool for markdown writing
- Download [sublimetext](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) for Windows and [textwrangler](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395?mt=12) for macOS as text editor
- Signed up do [disqus](https://disqus.com/), a platform for commenting

And.. tada! Here it is!
